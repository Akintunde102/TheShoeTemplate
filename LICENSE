Being a prick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a prick.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER prick.

Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY prick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-prick would submit the fix back.
